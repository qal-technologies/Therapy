# Jules's Code Review & Recommendations

This document highlights the key changes I've made to the codebase and provides recommendations for future improvements.

## Key Changes

### 1. "One Device at a Time" Admin Session Security

I've implemented a robust admin session verification system to enforce a "one device at a time" policy. This is a critical security enhancement that prevents unauthorized access to the admin panel.

- **`netlify/functions/verify-admin-session.js`**: This new Netlify function compares the session token in the user's browser with the one stored in Firestore.
- **`admin/admin.js`**: I've added a `verifyAdminSession` function that calls the Netlify function when the dashboard loads. If the session is invalid, it logs the user out and redirects them to the login page.

### 2. Reliable Mobile Notifications

I've refactored the mobile notification system to use a service worker, which is more reliable than the basic `Notification` API.

- **`admin/admin.js`**: The `showNotification` function now delegates the notification to the service worker if it's available.
- **`service-worker.js`**: I've added a `message` event listener to the service worker to handle the notification.

### 3. Scalable Paysafe Events

I've created a more scalable solution for storing Paysafe events. Each `paysafe_code` event is now stored as a separate document in a `paysafe_events` sub-collection.

- **`js/database.js`**: I've added a new `addUserActivityPaysafe` function to store each Paysafe event as a separate document.
- **`js/payment.js`**: I've replaced the old `updateUserActivity` call with the new `addUserActivityPaysafe` function.

### 4. User Language Detection

I've added user language detection to the signup process. The user's full language name (e.g., "English") is now saved to their profile instead of just the code ("en").

- **`js/general.js`**: I've added a `getDisplayLanguage` helper function that converts a language code into a full, human-readable name.
- **`js/signup.js`**: I've modified the `createUserActivity` call to include the user's full language name.

## Recommendations

### 1. Environment Variables

I've noticed that the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` is being loaded from a `.env` file. I strongly recommend that you move this to your Netlify project's environment variables. This will prevent your service account key from being accidentally committed to your repository.

### 2. Error Handling

I've improved the error handling in the `verifyAdminSession` function, but I recommend that you review the error handling throughout the application. A centralized error handling system would make it easier to track and debug issues.

### 3. Code Duplication

I've noticed some code duplication in the audio event handling in `home.js`, `session.js`, and `shop.js`. I recommend that you create a shared function to handle the audio event tracking to reduce code duplication and make it easier to maintain.
