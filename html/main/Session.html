                  <b>A book that speaks to every woman you have been, and every woman you are becoming.</b>
                  <br />
                  You see her on the cover.
                  Half of her is young, glowing, full of dreams.
                  The other half carries years, stories, and scars.
          
                  <br />
                  She is you.
                  All of you
                  the girl you once were,
                  the woman you are now,
                  and the one you are still becoming.
                  <br />
                  <br />
          
                  <b>The Moment This Book Was Born</b>
                  <br />
                  I began writing this book on a night when I sat alone on my kitchen floor, holding a cup of cold tea I‚Äôd
                  forgotten to
                  drink. I had been strong for everyone else,again,and no one noticed I was crumbling inside.
                  <br />
                  That night, I promised myself: If I ever find the way back to myself, I will leave a map for other women.
                  <br />
                  This book is that map.
                  <br />
                  This Is Not Just a Book
                  <br />
          
                  It is a companion for your soul,through heartbreak, through silence, through the nights you‚Äôve forgotten how to
                  breathe.
                  <br />
                  <br />
          
                  <b>It was written for:</b>
                  <br />
                  The woman who holds everyone else together, but has no one to hold her.
                  Therapists in Paris, Milan, and Rome call this emotional overfunctioning,giving without replenishment. You fear
                  that if
                  you let go, everything will collapse. And yet you quietly wonder: If I disappeared, would anyone notice?
                  <br />
                  <br />
          
                  The woman who has loved until she is empty and been left with nothing.
                  This is affective exhaustion,pouring out love until there is nothing left for you. You‚Äôve mistaken self-erasure
                  for
                  devotion, and when they left, all that remained was the echo of your own absence.
          
                  <br />
                  <br />
          
                  The woman who hides her pain behind a perfect smile.
                  In France, it‚Äôs la fa√ßade impeccable. In Italy, il sorriso di resistenza. You‚Äôve mastered the art of looking
                  fine while
                  storms rage inside. But the armor is heavy, and you long for someone who loves the woman without the smile.
                  <br />
          
                  The woman who feels time slipping through her fingers.
                  Therapists call it temporal anxiety,the fear that the ‚Äúright time‚Äù for love, children, career, or adventure has
                  already
                  passed. The years slip like sand through your hands, and you whisper in the dark: Did I live, or did I just
                  wait?
          
                  <br />

                  <br />
          
                  Every word is written like a hand reaching for yours in the dark.
                  Every chapter is a mirror, showing you your fragility and your power.
                  Every page is proof that someone finally, truly sees you.

                  <br />
          
                  This is your mirror.
                  Your healing.
                  Your reminder that you were never broken,only buried under the years.

                  Compagnon F√©minin will not just sit on your shelf.
                  It will live on your nightstand, travel in your bag, and rest in your hands on the days you feel like
                  disappearing.
