  <p>Dear {{first_name}},</p>
  <p>Welcome to Healing with Charlotte Casiraghi. I’m honoured that you’ve chosen to embark on this journey with me. Here, your story will be seen and treasured. Healing with me is not just therapy, it’s a rare and sacred connection.</p>

  <p><b>What you can expect:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Face‑to‑face connection.</b> Whether virtually or in person, we meet soul‑to‑soul.</li>
    <li><b>Personal letters & follow‑ups.</b> After each session, I write a private letter just for you and check in afterwards.</li>
    <li><b>An inner circle of support.</b> When needed, I introduce you to mentors and friends who can open new doors and invite you to intimate gatherings.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Next steps:</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Book your session:</b> Choose between Virtual, In‑Person or Community sessions. Each option includes unique bonuses and is tailored to your needs (prices range from €550 to €1,600).</li>
    <li><b>Explore our book:</b> Compagnon Féminin is a soul‑companion that speaks to every woman you’ve been and will become. Copies are limited, so consider reserving yours today.</li>
    <li><b>Review our FAQs:</b> Learn about payment methods (credit/debit cards or a 16‑digit paysafecard), rescheduling (72‑hour notice required) and confidentiality (all sessions are private).</li>
    <li><b>Stay connected:</b> As part of this community, you’ll receive occasional audio messages, reflections and special offers. You may opt out at any time.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Your healing journey is sacred. If you need anything, please reply to this email or write to healingwithcharlottecasiraghi@gmail.com.</p>
  <p>With warmth and gratitude,<br>Charlotte Casiraghi</p>
