What is a Paysafecard and how do I pay with it??

A Paysafecard is like cash in the form of a receipt.
You don‚Äôt need a bank account, credit card, or computer knowledge to use it. This is how it works, step by step:

Step 1: Buy a Paysafecard
Go to a supermarket, petrol station, or kiosk near you. Look for the Paysafecard logo. At the counter, ask for a Paysafecard of the amount you need (for example: 50‚Ç¨, 100‚Ç¨, etc.).

Step 2: Get Your Secure Code
The cashier will give you a small receipt. On it, you will see a 16-digit number (this is your secret code).
Keep it safe,it works just like cash.

Step 3: Pay Online with Your Code
When you come back to this website to pay, you will see a box that says:
‚ÄúEnter your Paysafecard code.‚Äù
Type in the 16-digit number from your receipt.

Step 4: Confirm Payment
After typing the number, simply press ‚ÄúPay Now with Paysafecard.‚Äù
Your payment is confirmed instantly.
No personal details, no bank needed.

Important Tips:

Think of the Paysafecard like using cash,safe, simple, and private.

 If the amount is bigger than one card, you 
can add more than one code until the full payment is covered.

Always keep your receipt safe until payment is completed.
